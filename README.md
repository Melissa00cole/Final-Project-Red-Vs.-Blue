# Final-Project-Red-Vs.-Blue

**Unit Description**

In this project I worked on a Red Team vs. Blue Team scenario in which I played the role of both pentester and SOC analyst.
As the Red Team, I attacked a vulnerable VM within our environment, ultimately gaining root access to the machine. 
As Blue Team, I used Kibana to review logs taken during the Day 1 engagement. I used the logs to extract hard data and visualizations for my report.
Then, I interpreted my log data to suggest mitigation measures for each exploit that I successfully performed.

**Unit Objectives:** 

This project prompted me to apply knowledge of the following skills and tools:


-Penetration testing with Kali Linux.


-Log and incident analysis with Kibana.


-System hardening and configuration.


-Reporting, documentation, and communication.




**Lab Environment**

In this unit, I used the Web Vulns lab environment located in Windows Azure Lab Services. as well as the Windows RDP host machine 
and the Hyper-V Manager to access the nested machines such as ELK.



**Security+ Domains**

This unit covers portions of the following domains on the Security+ exam:


-Types of attacks
-Indicators of compromise
-Penetration testing concepts
-Vulnerability scanning concepts
-Impact of vulnerabilities
-Security assessment tools

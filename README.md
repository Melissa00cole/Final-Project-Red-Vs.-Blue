# Final-Project-Red-Vs.-Blue

*Unit Description

In this project I worked on a Red Team vs. Blue Team scenario in which I played the role of both pentester and SOC analyst.
As the Red Team, I attacked a vulnerable VM within our environment, ultimately gaining root access to the machine. 
As Blue Team, I used Kibana to review logs taken during the Day 1 engagement. I used the logs to extract hard data and visualizations for my report.
Then, I interpreted my log data to suggest mitigation measures for each exploit that I successfully performed.

#Unit Objectives: 

project prompted me to apply knowledge of the following skills and tools:


-Penetration testing with Kali Linux.


-Log and incident analysis with Kibana.


-System hardening and configuration.


-Reporting, documentation, and communication.




#Lab Environment

In this unit, I used the Web Vulns lab environment located in Windows Azure Lab Services. as well as the Windows RDP host machine 
and the Hyper-V Manager to access the nested machines such as ELK.
